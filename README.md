## Features  
- Easy-to-Use Form: Users can enter details such as monthly bills, waste generated, and kilometers traveled.  
- Carbon Footprint Calculation: The app calculates CO2 emissions based on user input.  
- PDF Report: A professional and detailed report is generated, summarizing user data and results.  
- Responsive Design: Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.

## How It Works  
1. Data Input: Fill out the form with your own details like your energy bills, waste generated, and kilometers traveled for business and your City.  
2. Calculations: The app uses simple formulas to calculate your CO2 emissions and give you result.  
3. Downloadable Report: A PDF report is created with all the details and gives you results.

## Formulas Used  
1. Energy Use:  
   
   (Electric Bill * 12 * 0.0005) + (Gas Bill * 12 * 0.0053) + (Fuel Bill * 12 * 2.32)
     
2. Waste:  
   
   (Waste Generated * 12 * (0.57 - (Recycled Waste / 100)))
     
3. Business Travel:  
   
   (Kilometers Traveled * (1 / Fuel Efficiency) * 2.31)
